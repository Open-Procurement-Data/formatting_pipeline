### Create a virtual environment

Before creating the environment some packages might be necessary in order to create a virtual environment. Pick a python version which suits your project.

apt install python-venv

If the package above is already installed you can proceed further.


```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
